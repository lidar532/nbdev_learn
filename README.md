#### How `nbdev_learn` was built

1.  Create github repository using your browser.
2.  Generate ssh key for the repository.
3.  git clone the repository.
4.  Run `nbdev_new`: This populates the project repository.
5.  Populated `nbdev_learn/nbs` folder with notebook files
    `00_libA.ipynb` and `10_libB.ipynb`. These are the files that the
    package will be generated from. They contain the function defs., as
    well as the testing and example code.
6.  Created the Makefile and populated it with all of the operations
    that will be used to build up the package during development.

## What is nbdev_learn

`nbdev_learn` is a simple Python Notebook github based project intended
as a simple example of how to use the `nbdev` tools to generate python
packages, and modules complete with online web based documentation. It
consists of two module files, `libA` and `libB` each containing two very
simple functions.

    They are organized as:
    - nbdev_learn
      - libA.py
        - func_a()
        - func_b()
      - libB.py
        - func_d()
        - func_e()

`libA.py` is generated from the source python notebook `00_libA.ipynb`
and `libB.py` is generated by `10_libB.ipynb`.
