## What is nbdev_learn

`nbdev_learn` is a simple Python Notebook github based project intended
as a simple example of how to use the `nbdev` tools to generate python
packages, and modules complete with online web based documentation. It
consists of two module files, `libA` and `libB` each containing two very
simple functions.

They are organized as: - nbdev_learn - libA.py - func_a() - func_b() -
libB.py - func_d() - func_e()

`libA.py` is generated from the source python notebook `00_libA.ipynb`
and `libB.py` is generated by `10_libB.ipynb`.
